# Girly time tracker
It's a simple girly cute time tracker app. With each version there will be more functions available to this project. Stay tuned and remember to use glitter to your paperwork and documentation.

## Time tracking
This app gathers your time by entering specific data (hours and minutes as for now)

## Future updates
### I plan to implement:

Setting a list of options to which time can be counted (for example: fitness, programming, work ect.)

Different themes to choose from

Statistics page

Timer

Another way of adding time (from 16:30 to 17:20 = 0,83 hours)

Sounds

And more to come... (Imagination is the limit)


## How to use?
First open the terminal in the project directory.

Check if in main.js loadURL is commented. It can slip off my mind. Should look like this: 

`win.loadFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));`

`// win.loadURL('http://localhost:3000')`

Type `npm run build` and press enter. It can take a while

After it's done building, go to `dist` folder.

Open the `GirlyTimeTracker Setup 0.1.x.exe` file. 

It will download the app on your computer and make a shortcut on desktop. 

There is no need to keep the repository afterwards.
